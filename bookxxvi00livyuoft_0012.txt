viii INTRODUCTION

we can see from his style ; and his reserved and aristocratic tone may
be taken as evidence that he had been brought up amid the habitual
restraint and yram'tas of a Roman gentleman's household.

He settled in Rome probably about 30 B.c. He came there not to
push his fortunes or rise to a position of influence¹‚ but to study in
the imperial city for the history to which he was to devote his life.
In literary composition he found relies from the sight of the politica]
and socia] degeneration that had set in everywhere. At Rome, in
the court of Augustus, at the table of the Emperor the old Pompeian
was a Pompeian still. Augustus laughingly taunted him with his
republican tendencies²; when, as his history progressed‚ he came to
tell of the struggles of the expiring Republic he spoke with respect
of Pompey and refused to brand as murderers the assassins of Caesar-³ ;
and yet he was so intimate with the members of the imperial house
as to be allowed to influenee the tastes of the future Emperor
Claudius‘. On the death of Augustus he returned to his native
Patavium, where he died in 17 A.D.

His history of Rome was only part, though by far the greater part,
of his literar-y activity. He wrote ‘dialogues which,' says Seneca,
‘one could recl-:on as history quite as much as philosophy,' besides
books dealing professedly with philosophica] subjects ⁵. Quintilian
quotes a letter he wrote to his son. a treatise on rhetoric for his use ¹³:
and his connexion with rhetoric is further shown by the marriage of
his daughter to a rhetor-ician Magius whose only recommendation
to posterity is that he was Livy's son-in-law. But his history was his
life-work. It was written in 142 books. He began to write not
before 27 13.c.⁷ He had got as far as the ninth book before 20 B.c.
Before Augustus died he had published the part of his work dealing
with the life of Pompey. These dates imply constant and regular
writing over a period of foi-ty years. The work was divided into
books and published in sections. Books VI, XXI, and XXXI are
furnished with their separate prefaees and therefore stood each at
the beginning of a separate group of books. The whole work was
entitled Ab Urbe Condita libri cxrn, but the separate parts had
