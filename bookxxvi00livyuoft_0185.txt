§ 23. traducite, ‘lead the way across?
multis fortibus : for nzzcltis etsurllbus ; cf. e. 39. 3.
peragratas, ‘ traversed from end to end,’ an exaggerate-d reference to
the initial successes of the Scipios. Ι
§ 24. noscitatis : f01·aqzzoscz'tis‚ ‘recognize't Riemann (Etmles, p. 18, n. 2)
thinks that the employment of frequentative forins without a frequentative
meaning was borrowed from popular Latin; cf. royz'to (xxiv. 31. 3), imperito
(xxi. 1. 3).
oris uultusque. The distinction between these words is well brought
out in Cic. (Ic Or. iii. 59. 221 sed in ore sunl onznia, ‘all depends on tho

regionis eius: i. e. 'I'arraco and the friendly district to the N. os the
libro.
copias: Livy‘s numbers hardly ;1‹·‹:0nnt sor the whole of Scipio's
army. The senate had sent 12.ooo foot und 1,1oo horse with Nero (e. 17. 1] :
these were reinforced by Silanus with 1070001'00t and 1‚ooo horse (c. 19. ιο] z
Scipio himself raises 5,000 socii (e. 4¹. 2 . This makes 27‚000 foot ‘'count-
ing the socii as soot-soldiers) and 2,100 horse. But he had in addition the
veteran army of the Scipio-s, f‹›r which Livy‘s numbers only allow 1‚000
foot and 700 horscwa quite impossible figure. Polybius merely gives the
number of the soldiers lest with Silanus as 3‚000 foot and 500 horse.

§ 2. quibusdam: Polybius has nothing of this, and it ean hardly bo
correct as Livy states it. There would be 110 reom for such discussions
when the Ebro was crossed—Scipio would not have gone across without
knowing what he was· going io do, especially if, as Polybius says, he had
made all inquiries at Tarraco that he thought likely to be of service in the
attempt on New Carthago.

diuersas: see (¹. 20. 6 for Livy's account of the winter-quarters of the
Carthaginians. Polybius (x. 7. 5] gives a different version Μάγωνα μὲν
