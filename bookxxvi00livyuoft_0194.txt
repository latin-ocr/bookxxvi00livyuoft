§ 10. caedes. NVhat the capture ofa town meant when the Romans
were victors we see from the horrible description of Polybius gx. 15. 5⁸,
πολλάκις ἰδεῖν ἔστιν ἐν ταῖς τῶν Ῥωμαίων καταλήψεσι τῶν πόλεων οὐ μόνους τοὺς
ἀνθρώπους πεφονευμένους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς κύνας δεδιχοτομημένους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων
ζώων μέλη παρακεκομμένα : cf. the description in ix. 14. 12 of the capture of
a Samnite camp in 320 nec ullum superfuisset animal m· consules receptui
siquam dedissem, and that Of Iliturgi in 206 usque acl infantium caedem ira
cruchlis peruenit, xxviii. 20. 6. Polybius says that the Romans did this
καταπλήξεως χάρινι just as Cromwell in his despatch to Bradshaw, after
coolly announeing that he had put the entire gari-ison of Drogheda to the
sword, says, ‘And truly I believe this bitterness will save much effusion
of blood, through the goodness of God’ (Carlyle’s Cromwell, Letter civ);
but the Romans do not seem to have used the name of their gods to cloak
these barbarities.
