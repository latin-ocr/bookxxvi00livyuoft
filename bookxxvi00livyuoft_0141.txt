for the senate to recognize the display of a power which did not exist. In
this ease a special dispensation from the laws was necessary, which could
originally be granted only by the people. The Senate took the initiative

arrangement) Groenidge, Rom. Publ. Life, p. 158.

ξ 6. iniret: the subj. denotes purpose.

Albano: at the temple of Jupiter Latiaris : as Marcellus had no army

the impersonal passive.

Nasum : i. e. τὴν Νῆσον, the island os Ortygia.
