xxviii JNTRODUCTJON

We should find in their place 1110 description of ssight, 1-0111, and pursuit
in 1110 majestic prose of which he is a master, and, 10 conclude, a settle-
1110111 ‘ in accordance with the clemency 011110 Roman people ’ : and we
should feel 111111 1110 populus Romanus was too prend 10 110 ν111(11011νο,
and 111111 justice combined with mercy had no snrer saffiguard, hardly
a more sublime sanction, than in 1110 immemori-al attributes of 1110
Roman people.

But his 11111110115111 is a feeling 1101 wholly unmixed with sear. The
outlook for 1110 Empire was 1101 free from clouds. Patriob as he wa8,
he could 1101 conceal from himself a gradual weakening of 1110 moral
fibre, a relaxation of 1110 virtues, 111111 had made Rome great ¹. His
boyhood had been 5110111 11111111 1110 warlike scenes which saw the last
of 1110 old Republic. and in Livy's eyes 1110 worse cause had triumphed.
The old 1100 civic life which, with all 115 abusos, had been 1110 nursery
of 1110 Roman virtues was gone for ever. The population was decreas
ing, morality was ceasing to bc fashionable, family 1105 were being
loosened 2, wealth, 05101111111011. and luxury were 011 1110 increase. Hc
sees in 1110 history of 1110 Empire a gradual decline: first, the almost
imperceptible relaxation of restraint, 111011 1110 long-ing for licence,
11151, 1110 headlong 111511 on 1110 downward path, imus imus praecipites,
‘ 1111 we have reached an age in which neither our vices nor attempts
10 reform 1110111 can possibly be endured 3.' Livy adds with a wistful
inconsistency one remedium 1110 more. His book is an attempt 10 hold
up 10 a degenerate city a picture of the heroes and 1110 111511111110115
which had made 1110 Empire. He entreats his reader 10 · look upon 11115
pic-ture and upon 111111,’ and concludes his preface with a prayer for
the Divine blessing upon his labours, addressed 10 the gods and god-
desses in whom his contemporaries believed no more.
