inm-h on the ground of expedition that the case in the text was referred
‘to recuperatore as because one of the claiinants was a socius. See Greenidge,
Rom. Pam. Lsfc, p. 293 sq.

daturum: the word used to denote the aetion of the magistrate in
naming the members of the tribunal. The participle in acrum is often used
without esse for the future infinitive3 Dr. Postgate has shown (Classical
Rei-lew, v. 301) that esse was not originally used with this form of the verb.

cognita: coqnoscere is the technical word sor the aetion of the ludex,
who, under the direction of the praetor, inquires into the facts of a case
and pronounces sentence in accordanee with the praetor's ruling on the
point of law. The use of the word here denotes that the recuperatores were
to inquire into the facts only ; effect would be given to their (leci-‘sion by
Scipio.

ξ) 9. aduocatis, ‘ supportem.⁹ The word always means in Cicero a
friend who lende his support or advice in a trial, never an ‘advocates
a meaning which does not appear till Imperial times. See Ramsay,
Ram. Ant. p. 356.

de medio, ⁴ as 1·eferee,’ lit. ‘from the neutral standpoint‚' as con·
tras-ted with the parti pris of the others.

recuperatores with cons-idere, ‘to sit as· recuperatores* : for manescere
cansam see note on counita above.

ᾧ 10. eo: answered hy qnod, not5 as is usual, quo.

amoti, ‘the weight of their great influcnce had been lost, not so
much to the support of their side, as to the repression of excitement!
‹liynitatis qualifies both aduocati and moderatore&

consilio, ⁴ the board ⁵ : sor consilium cf. e. 16. 103 36. 1.

tribunal, ‘the bench‚' where Scipio was waiting to pronounce his
sentence after hc heard their decision.

§ 11. modo ac modestia, ‘order or self-restraint ἐ modus denotes the
outward appearance produced by modestia, the virtue of moderation.

manus . . . conferant, ‘come to blows': manns conserere is more
frequently used in this sense.

exemplo, ‘the proceedings were setting a notoriously bad precedent!

quippe ubi: See e. 46. 2 n.

ξ 12. hinc . . . hinc, ⁴ on one side stood the legionaries, on the other
the marines, ready to swear by every god in heaven at the bidding of
their prejudiees, instead of their conscienoes, and expose to the guilt of
perjury not only their persons and lives, but the standards and eagles
of the legions and their sacred honour as souliers? uera esse depends
upon iurare and the subject ef esse is to be supplied from quae : for caput
see c. 47. 1 : sacramenti relc'yionem = ‘the sanctity attaching to their
military oath.' The use of hinc . . . hinc for hinc . . . illinc appears to he
poetic.
