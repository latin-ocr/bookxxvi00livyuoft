INTRODUCTION xv

modest story at the beginning parades itself, in some later writer,
in all the borrowed plumage of rhetoric ¹.

With the enormous development of rhetorical training and the in-
creased importance of the schools of rhetoric the conception of the aim
of the historian’s art had deteriorated. History was looked upon as
a useful study for a statesman and, above all, an inexhaustible mine
for an orator. Boys learnt rhetorio by deliven'ng speeches upon some
famous historica] scene, or illustrated some vice or virtue by examples
drawn from Greek 01· Roman history or historica] romanoe. This was
true not merely of a later age : Cicero insists in more than one passage
upon history as, after all, subordinate 1ο 1110 rhetorician’s art, or classes
it with mythology as a useful storehouse of exa1nples2.

Of all this we find the traces in Livy: but to do him justice 110 15
far superior to his predecessore, and followers. With a better style than
the former he has at least an equal, if not a greater, love of truth, and
if not always successful in steering clear of the shoals and quicksands
of error he has at least a knowledge that they abound and a fairly
accurate idea of where they are to be met. He is aware of the exag-
gerations of family annals and funeral orations³z 110 has learned to
distrust the enormous numbers given hy such a writer as Valerius
Antias& even if at first he fell into the trap of following hi111³·; he is
under few illusions as to the trustworthiness of much of the early
hist01·y⁰,but‚ contenting himselfwith a few genem] warnings‚ he takes
what 110 finds and makes 1110 best of it. But even Livy is the slave of
tradition in many respects. The historialis of his day cared little for,
or had never learned, the claims of accurate truthfulncss, and Livy
makes many a statement in perfect good saith which in a modern
writer would be regarded as definite evidence of malafides· or 0111100-
pacity. There is a famous instance 1111110 fourth book ⁷. Livy had stated
that A. Cornelius Cossus was tribunus militnm when he won the spolia
opima in 437 B.(⁴. ⁵³. But Augustus had discovered, by examining the
inscription on the spolia in question, that Cossus had been, not tribune,
