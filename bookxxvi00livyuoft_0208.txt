avoids detail. According to it. Hannibal marched through Samnium
(διὰ τῆς Σαυνίτιδα) and crossed the Anio before the city was aware of
his approach, 1·itching his camp five miles from the walls (ix. 5. 8
and 9). All that we can gather from this is, that Polybius supposed
him to have come by a road leading to Rome across the Anio.

Appian (Hann. 38 sqq.) tells a very vague story. He marched
through ‘many hostile nations, some of whom were not able to stop
him. while others did not even risk a trial of strength’ (διελθὼν ἔθνη
πολλὰ καὶ πολέμια, τῶν μὲν οὐ δυνηθέντων αὐτὸν ἐπισχεῖν, τῶν δὲ οὐδὲ ἐς
πεῖραν ἐλθεῖν ὑποστάντων), and encamped on the Anio, four miles from
the city. The people of Alba sent a detachment to aid the Romans—
a statement which implies that Hannibal came by some route in their
neighbourhood.

The question of the route followed by Hannibal is closely connected
with the question of his intention. Livy says (c. 7. 3 sqq.)‚ that he
conceived the idea of attacking Rome, ‘an attack he had always
wished to make, though it was the common complaint of others that
he had let the opportunity for it slip after the battle of Cannae, and
he himself could not attempt to conceal it; it was not (he thought)
too much to hope that some pait at least of the city could be seized

both the Roman generals would immediately leave Capua alone, or
nt least one of them would, and, in the event of their dividing their
forces, both would be weakened, and give either himself or the people
of Capua an opportunity for striking a blow.' He was led to form
this design by the impossibility of iaising the siege, and the fear that
the new consuls would cut off his supplies; he was leaving Capua
inrito incepto. Clearly Livy regards the Capuans as now left to shift
for themselves. Hannibal's attack upon Rome was a serious attempt
to 3101111 1110 city, which would have as a necessaiy consequence the
raising of the siege of Capua by the Romans. Now, if Hannibal
