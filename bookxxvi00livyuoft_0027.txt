INTRODUCTION xxiii

Campani as ca'etes Romani (c. 33. 10 sqq.)-a point passed over in the
previous narrative—and, though they are represented as appealing to
the Senate from the cruelties of Fulvius, there is no hint of the fact-
that the Senate had already considered and settled the case. In fact
there is strong evidence to show that the source followed here knew
of no such previous settlement. In c. 16. 6 we are told that all the
citizens with the exception of the nobiles who were imprisoned at
Rome or throughout Italy were sold: according to the narrative in
c. 34 a large proportion are merely deported from Campania, ancl yet
we read (c, 34. 13) ob haec decreta maestiores aliquanto, qnam Romam
uenerant, Campanos dinn'serunt. The statement is unintelligible if the
previous account be correct. Nor can we sec why the selling of an
entire population is not mentioned in c. 33. 2 at least along with, if
not instead of, the fate of the nobles in the compl-aiut which the
ambassadors make of the severity of their fate. In c. 33. 4 Fulvius is
eredited with the whole responsibility for thc fate ot' Capua. and his
case is put on a par with that of Marcellus : in Regulus⁷ speech the
decisionis regarded as that of the consuls. and the right of the Senate
to interfere iniussn populi (as they are represented tohave done in the
previous account) is expressly denied, nor does Regulus appear to bc
aware of any punishment inflicted on the town beyond the beheading
of the Senators: the formal decree of the plebs seems absurd if the
Senate had already settled the question and were now merely consider-
ing the possibility of relaxing the severity of the punishment: the
postponement (in c. 34. 4> of the case of some Capuans seems strange
if this was a final adjudication upon appeal. We seem forced to the
conclusion that Livy has been using two sources one of which placed
the decision in 211, while the other, evidently a better informed and
fuller source, placed it in 210. This latter source then looked upon
Fulvius as in absolute command of the fate of the Capuans by virtue
of his imperium militiae till 210, when they appealed to the Senate, who
iussu populi finally decided upon their fate.

Chapters 35 and 36 are again from some annalistic source, and there
seems to be no necessity for supposing it to be other than that followed
in the previous section.

What this source is we must now consider. We have already seen
that chapters 18 to 20 are probably from Coelius: with regard to
chapters 21—23 we have no hint to lead us to infer any change in the
