111 each side. The peninsula is· connected with the mainland by
an isthmus 1ο 1118 1101111, 111111 15 surrounded by the sea on the east.
111111, 5011111. Τ11818 is another isthmus to the south, separating the
5811 froin a lake which extends round to the west and north, where it
is again separated from the sea by the northern isthmus. The
isthmus on the south had been cut through for the convenience of
fishermen, thus connecting the sea and the lake3 111111 across the
eentre of this canat there was 11 bridge. The peninsula itself con—
sisted of five 111115, and on these hills 111111 111 1118 valley between them
lay the town. The hill ot Asklepios, 111111 that crowned by the citadel,
lay respectively to the east and west: they 1118 1118 modern Mt.
Concepcion and Mt. Molinete. The other three hills were much
lower 111111 5111111181, and lay to the north in a kind of semicircle ; they
were the hill of Hephaistos (modern Castillo de Despefia Perros), the
hill of Aletes (Mt. S. Jose), 111111 1118 11111 of Kronos (Mt. Sacro);
of these three, the first fronted the northern isthmus, while the
others lay to the west of 11. Ν8111· 1118 northern isthmus on the
11111111101111 was 11 hill, the tumulus Mercurii (modern Castillo de los
Mor-os).

This description has been subjected by some modern 111111101111851
10 a very severe examination. The net result of their investigations
is briefly this: the orientation of the site 115 given by Livy and
Polybius is hopelessly wrong; 1118 island (Escombrera) which is
supposed to close the mouth of the buy, does as a matter of fact
nothing of the kind, 111111 1118 wind blowing from its direction is not
the south-west but 1118 5011111-5011111-81151ς 111111 1118 three smaller and
lower hills are. 115 a matter of fact, not so very much lower than the
others.

Droysen solves the difficulty in part by supposing that Polybius
made 11 sketch on the spot, but fol-got to put in the points of the
001111)asS‚ and made 11 mistake in putting them in afterwards.
Straohan-Davidson supposes that 118 was led asti-ay by taking the
north by the position of the Pole Star‚ which in 156 B.c. was 12⁰
away from the true north. On Droysen's hypothesis, Polybius was
90O out of the true reckoning3 Strachan-Davidson makes his error
