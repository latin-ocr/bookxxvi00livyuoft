A PPENDIX I 1 73

ten days to complete his journey, and Livy insisto· upon these ten
days as if they were a necessary part of his plan. It is impossible
to believe that Livy had any clear and accurate idea of the whole
episode.

Polybius* account· (ix. 4. 6 sqq.) is what one expects from Polybius.
‘Hannibal coming to the conclusion that- it was impossible to raise
the siege by an offhand blow (διὰ τῆς ἐκ χειρὸς βίας) adopted another
plan. He conceived that if he should make a secret march, and
appear suddenly in the neighbourhood of Rome, he might perhaps
meet with some success even in the neighbourhood of the city
(ἴσως μὲν ἂν καὶ περὶ τὴν πόλιν ἀνῦσιισθαί τι τῶν χρησίμων), surprising·
and terrifying the inhabitants: or failing that, he would at least
compel Appius and his army to raise the siege in their eager-
ness to come to t-he help of their native city, or by dividing the
army both the relieving force and those left behind would fall an
easy prey.’ The opening sentence is perfectly explicit. Hannibal's
march was to be a means of raising the blockade of Capua ; a success
in the neighbourhood of Rome was all that was to be thought of,
and even that was subordinate to his main purpose. To secure this,
secrecy and dispatch were necessary, and secrecy and dispatch were
employed. Hannibal intended the news of Rome's danger to come
as a stunning blow upon Appius, frightening him into a frenzied
rush to rescue the city before it was too late. He took care that
none of the enemy should learn of his departure (ὣστε μηδένα συνεῖναι
τῶν πολεμίων τὸ συμβαῖινον); he marched χρησάμενος ταῖς πορείαις . .
ἐνεργοῖς καὶ συνεχέσιε his route was cai-efully explored to guard
against. surprise, and he fell upon Rome like a thunderbolt, (τοῦ
πράγματος αἶφνιδίου μὲν ὄντος καὶ τελέως ἀνελπίστου). He had cal·
culated the length of time it would take for the news of his appear-
anee before Rome to reach Appius, and rouse him to the rescue
(συλλογιζόμενος- τὰς ἡμέρας ἐν αἷς ἤλπιζε . . . πυθομένους τοὺς περὶ τὸν
'‘An-nm ν. . .παραβοηθήσειι, c. 7. 2), and disappeared from before Rome
when he hoped Appius would be leaving Capua. He failed: but not
by deserving failure (as on Livy* s showing he would have desei-ved it),
but because Appius did not leave Capua, and the defendeis of the
city would not let him out of their sight. This is a consistent and
intelligible account, and leaves nothing to be desired but the details
of the route.
