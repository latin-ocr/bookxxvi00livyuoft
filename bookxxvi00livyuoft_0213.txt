only 45⁹. Cuntz points out that neither solution accounts for the
fact that while the positions of the hills are hopelessly wrong in
Polybius, he gives the direction of the mouth of the harbour with
something approaching precision. He also points out that Polybius
in this passage makes use of only the four cardinal points of the
compass, while elsewhere he reckons by intermediate points as well,
that he is particularly eareful as a general rule in doing so, and
knew quite well the declination of the Pole Star from the true north.
With regard to the position of Escombrera. there is one point in the
harbour from which an observes stationed 111 a boat might suppose
that the island closed the mouth of the harbour, but from no other
point could such a niistake be made. Lastly, Droysen and Strachan-
Davidson do not explain the cause of Polybius' error about the height
of the hills.

Cuntz tries to prove that previous investigators took for granted
that Polybius had inspected the site personally, relying upon what-
seenis a definite statement of the histor-ian: he says (x, 11. 4), ὁ δέ
περίβολος τῆς πόλεως οὐ πλεῖον εἴκοσι σταδίων ὑπῆρχε τὸ πρότερον. καίτοι
γ’ οὒκ ἀγνοῶ, διότι πολλοῖς εἴρηται τετταράκοντα· τὸ δ’ ἐστὶ ψεῦδος· οὐ γὰρ
ἐξ ἀκοῆς ἡμεῖς ἀλλ’ αὐτόπται γεγονότες μετ’ ἐπιστάσεως ἀποφαινόμεθα.
The claim to credit as an eyewitness (Cuntz argues-J) extends only
to the statements with regar-d 1ο measurcments‚ and this sen-
tence belongs only to a second edition of the Histoi-ies, forming
110 part of the original work, the first fifteen books of which were
published before 150 Rc.. while this sentence was added aster
133 B. C. lf this be so (and the arguments adduced by Cuntz seem
very strong) the description given by Polybius was copied from
some, presumably, Greek source which paid little attention to topo-
graphica] accura0y3 that this was a· besetting sin of Polybius’
predecessors we know from his frequent complaints. Livy got his
description in all probability from some Roman source which had
made use of Polybius' narrative.
