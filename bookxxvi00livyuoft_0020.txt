xvi INTRODUCTION

but consul at the time. Livy allows his original statement to stand,
appencling a note cmboclying Augustus’ discovery more as a compli-
ment to the Emperorthan as a sen'ous contribution to criticism.

Twice in the XXVlth book does Livy quote his authorities : once
to differ from Coelius Antipater in the account of Hannibal's march
upon Rome ¹; and the second time when in enumerating the spoils
taken at New Carthage he discusses the variations in the accounts ².
But it is possible for a careful criticism to recover other traces of
dependence upon certain authorities and to construet, at least in
outline, the literary pedigree of the book ⁸.

For the opening chapter Lixy had the annales maximi, the fasti, or
lists of magistrates, and the records‚ meagre enough no doubt, of the
resolutions of the Senate 4; but it is unlikely that he consulted these
at first hand. Annalists before his day had done so, and Livy entered
into their labours. The speeches in chapters 2 and 3 we must regard
as practically his own composition: it was the invariable custom
of historians to compose these for themselves, and where we have
the opportunity of comparing Livy with other authorities we find
that where each has inserted a speech Livy's is almost entirely inde-
pendent of the other'z The question as to which particular an-
nalist Livy was following here is another matter: we find nothing to
assist in answering it till we come to c. 6. 9. Here Livy, after
following a clearly exaggerated account, notes that he finds apud alios
something more reasonable. Now the first account, besides being
exaggerated, is from the Roman standpoint: the second is not only
more moderate, but inclines to the Carthaginian side ⁶, and ascribes
a stratagem to Hannibal not mentioned by the other. This stratagem
we find again in Appian ⁷, but in another context. All this points to
Coelius Antipater, one of Livy's main authorities for this war. Coelius

has separated the incident from its context.
