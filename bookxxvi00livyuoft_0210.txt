174 LIVY. BOOK XXVI

Appiam (loc. 011.) declares that Hannibal knew of a famine at
Rome when he started, and that 110 ‘hoped either to force thc
generals to leave Capua, or to accomplish something himself of more
importance than Capua' (ἐλπίζων δὲ τοὺς στρατηγοὺς αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Καπύης
ἀναστήσειν ἢ αὐτός τι Καπύης· μεῖζον ἐργάσεσθαι). Hannibal, he says.
marched with the utmost speed (συντόνῳ σπουδῇ). Τ110 most that can
be said for this vague statement 13 that it does not contradict
Polybius, while part of it is irreconcilable with Livy's account.

We cannot then be far wrong in preferring the consistent and
probable account of Polybius to the vague and contradictory state-
ments of Livy. Two points remain to be considered; the question of
the details of Hannibal's march, and the further question of how,
supposing it to be erroneous, the account followed by Livy arose.

On the first of these questions, the details given by Coelius are
clearly wrong. For Hannibal to have gone from Sulmo to the
Marrucini would have served excellently to mystify curiosity as to
his objective‚ but could hardly have served any other purpose. Even
if, with Arnold (ΗΜ. of Rome, iii. 406), wc suppose Marrucinos to be
a blunder for Marrubios (c. 11. 11), 31111 1110 route is far too round—
about to be consistent with even a moderate desire to huri-y. If he
really passed Alba, as Coelius says (and Appian implies)‚ 110 probably
joined the via Valeria not far from the town, and marched straight
down it to Rome (Mommsen, Rom. He'st. i. 338 sq). One slight hint
in Livy points in this direction. He says that the Romans, 011 1110
news of Hannibal’s march, put a gai-rison in the cmc Aefedana (c. 9. 9);
this would command the ria Valeria, but would be of no use at all if
Hannibal were coming by the ria Latina ; as the statement is thus in-
consistent with his own story, he must have found it somewhere and
put it in without consideration. It is equally inconsistent, of course,
with what seems 1110 true versi0n3 if the march of Hannibal and his
route were unknown, no gai-rison could have been put there as Livy
says ; but the statement at any rate assumes the existence of a tradi-
tion that Hannibal did come by the via Valeria. How then did
Hannibal's march come to be connected with the ria Latina at all‘?
On this point 0110 01111 only hazard a conjecture.

There was a shrine of a god Rediculus or Tutanus near the Capene
Gate, at which point Hannibal was said to have turned back from his
attempt on the city (Rede'euli J'anzmz (arb-a portam Fapenam fuit, qnia
