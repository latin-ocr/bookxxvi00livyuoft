PREFACE

THE present edition of the twenty-sixth book of Livy was
undertaken primarily for the use of students in the Royal
University of Ireland, and the fact that it aims at satisfying
the needs of both Pass and Honours candidates will, it is
hoped, be taken as a sufficient excuse for a certain inequality
of standard in the notes.

The editions that have been used in the preparation of the
commentary are those of XVeissenborn, as revised by Mffller,
of Friedersdorff and of Riemann and Homolle. Riemann's
Eteocles sm· la Lcmssnc et [α Grcmzmcaeire dc silc-Lice and
Kiihnast’s Licianisclcc Syntcw: have been specially useful.
Obligations to one or other of these have been incurred on
every page: obligations to other authorities are noted in
their respective places.

The Editor's special thanks are due to his friend and
former teacher, Prof. T. W. Dougan, of Queen‘s College.
Belfast, who not only found time, in the midst of many
pressing engagements of his own, to read the book both
in manuscript and in proof, but generously permitted the
use of a number of his manuscript notes. VVhere these
have been directly adopted in the following pages they are
enclosed within square brackets and marked with Prof.
Dougan’s initials: but the Editor is conscious that they
represent only a small part of the debt which the com-
mentary owes to his kindness and learning.
