INTRODUCTION xi

models kept him free from the faults which a similar environment
was to produce in others in the long run. But there is for all that
to be discerned in his style the first tint of the autumn. He stands
at the head of the long decline which passed through Seneca and
Tacitus (both stylists of the first rank and the last of that rank at
Rome) down to the gorgeous mosaics of Apuleius.

Livy was the master of a periodic style that has never been
rivalled, but his periods are not the periods of Cicero. His language
is, so to speak‚ more sels-conscious: he abounds in poetical turns
and words which seem to be chosen, not because they express the
meaning better, but because they are unusual and arresting. His
period is longer and more involved than Cicero's: one cannot say
that it is more artistic or more harmonicus: but in Livy the art is
not, as in Cicero, subordinate to the sense so much as an end
pursued for its own sake and parallel to the meaning, and the
divided allegiance does not always make for perspicuity. One
grasps Cicero’s meaning as soon as one reaches the last word in the
sentence ; another reading only makes one wonder if that particular
meaning could possibly be expressed in any better way: but a,
repeated reading of Livy's sentences leaves one wonder-ing how such
a delicately balanced structure was built, and how long it took in
the building: word answers to word and phrase to phrase: one
pauses involuntarily to gather up the many concurrent or converging
lines and cast a final glauce at the proportions of the whole before
proceeding. It is the style, not of the statesman and the Forum, but
of the orator driven from the invigorating contests of the open air
to the leisured practice of his alt in the somewhat enm-vating ease
of the nita umbratilis.

Yet with all this, sometimes too obtrusive, art Livy can write in
a style of marvellous cleamess and simplicity. His vocabulaiy is not
so extensive as one might imagine when one remembers the vast field
of the early literature which he laid under contribution. The same
words and phrases recur, but so cunningly placed and fitted that we
are never conscious of monotony: the word in its new setting seems,
and to all intents is for the reader, a new word. Livy had mastered
the art of varying his style. He ean be even bald upon occasion, or
again he can charm and almost bewilder us with some lengthened
cadence moving majestically along his page: and before the reader
