to make a systematic use of Polybius till he came to write Book 30.
Again there is a curious discrepancy between the account of Laem'nus'
operations given in these chapters and the short notice in c. 28. 1—2,
a discrepancy so glaring as only to be explained by a difference
between the sources followed in the two passages, But why did Livy
not do away with the discrepancy by a stroke of his pen‘? The
answer given by Soltau¹ seems convincing: the passage in question
(cc. 24—26. 4) was inserted from Polybius after the rest of the book had
been composed‚ and simply put in without any attempt to adapt it to
its context.

From c. 26.5 on we again come upon a Roman annalistic source:
that it was strongly on the Roman side we can see from the exaggerated
account given in c. 28. 2 of Laevinus' exploits in Greece : the accounts
of the fire in the forum in c. 27 and of the distribution of the armies
and provinces in c. 28 go back to the annales maoez'mi: the fact of the
Sicilian embassy appear-ing in the Senate probably comes from the
same source, though here again the art displayed in the composition
of the speeches (particularly that of Marcellus in c. 31) is Livy's
addition to his authority. The discrepancies between these state-
ments and Livy’s previous account of the capture of Syracuse point-
to a difference in the sources employed. It is fairly certain that Livy's
account of the capture of Syracuse was subjected to a revision after
he became acquainted with the worth of Polybius' work, and that his
original account (of which he has suffered some fragments to remain) v
was derived from Coelius ², These new extracts from Polybius were
added after the twenty—ninth book had been written and therefore
after the narrative here had assumed its present form. Livy did not
take the trouble to revise all his references to Syracuse, to make them
agree with the new version, and discrepancies like those here referred
to are the result. It is therefore prob-able that the references here are
based upon the original authority for the capture of Syra-cnse, i.e.
Coelius Antipater.

The narrative of the discussion in the Senate upon the fate of the

Campanians, contained in cc. 33 and 34. is almost certainly from some »

source other than that followed in c. 16. 5-13. It is very much fuller,
it lays stress upon the constitutional question of the rights of tho
