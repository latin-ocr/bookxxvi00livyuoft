signa: the standards of the maniples: the aquila did not rank as
the standard of the legion as a whole till the time of Marius, so that
Livy‘s reference to the ‘eagles’ here is inaccurate. The standai-ds were
considered sacred and while in the camp were kept in a sacrarium close
to the general's quarters [Cic. Cat. i. 9. 24 ; Dio Cas-s. xl. 18. Ι) [Tac. Hist.

pariterzsinwl. There is nothing of this whole story in Polybius,
and he would hardly have omitted it had he known it3 it would have
sen-ved him as another instance of S‹·ipio’s ἀγχίνοια, too characteristic to be
omitted. But lie would ‚scarcely have represented Scipio as telling one
lie to save the soldiers from the guilt os another.

ξ 14. corona: the golclen ‹frown was conscrrcd sor any signal service ;

cf. c. 21. 9.

bubus: probably to provide materials sor a sacrifice and subsequent
