their own special titles derived from the events they dealt with ¹.
The last event mentioned was the death of Drusus in B.c. 9. It has
been supposed that Livy intended to bring the number of books up
to 150 and finish with the death of Augustus. But unless he knew
when Augustus would die and what would happen before he did
it is not easy to see how he could form such a plan.

The success of his work was immediate and complete, and his
fame extended over the world during his life. Pliny tells of a
provincial from Gades who came to Rome simply to see Livy and
having seen him went away content ². For small libi-aries and busy
men room and time were saved by the use of epitomes of his huge
work ²³. It crushed out of existence at once all previous historians
by its sheer weight and excellence. What they had said was to be
found much better said 111 the puges of Livy ⁴. But such an unwieldy
bulk could hardly escape dislocation on the waters of time. Of the

’ 142 books only thirty-five rem-uin : namely books I-X and XXI—XLV,

and even of these XLI and XLIII are incomplete. There are however
summaries (periochae) extant of all the books with the exception 01·
CXXXVI and CXXXVII.

In such an extensive work the critic-S, whether hostile or friendly,
found ample niaterials for praise or blame. The eurof Asinius Pollio ⁵,
attuned to the harmonies of the urban idiom, detected a faint
Patavinian dissonance iu the style. Modern critics without his oppor-
tunities of forming a. judgement have essayed to rival his penetration
and have spent many an idle 110111· 111 attempts to produce the
evidence for his ve1·(lict⁶. The Emperor Caligula, in a philological
phase, was for expelling his works from all libraries 011 the grounds
of his verbosity and carelessness⁷. Tacitus gives him the praise
of combined eloquence and good saith Β. Quintilian, whose word in
these matters is law, says& ‘Herodotus would not object to be
