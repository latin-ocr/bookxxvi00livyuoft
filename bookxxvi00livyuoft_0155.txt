5 2. conpulsum: this account of the operations is inconsistent with
that given in cc. 24-6. Livy there adopts the same account as Polybius ε

1egio: the strength of a Roman legion varied at different periods.
During the earliest period it consisted of 3,000 foot soldiers : during the
period of the early wars its strength was about 4,000 ε from the outbreak
of the war with Hannibal till the reforms of Marius it seldom fell below
5,000‚ and Livy evidently regards this as the normal number. Three
hundred was the regular complement of cavalry.

ξ 8. stipendia, ‘those who had seen most service '; stipendium, lit. ‘pay‚'
is often used in the sense of ‘campaign‚’ the period during which the
pay is earned.

by the allies was usually larger. Numer-als are often corrupted in MSS.

disxnissing the veterans': ueteribus is really redundant, being implied in
the former part of the sentence. es. c. 6. 2 τ 16. 4 and nutes.
