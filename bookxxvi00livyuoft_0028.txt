source : they are evidently from a Roman annalist. From chapter 24. 1
to chapter 26. 4 is an extract from Polybius, while from 26. 5 on wc
have a continuous narrative which in its reference to Syracuse seems
to point to Coelius, while in the Chapters dealing with the Campanians
it is clearly at variance with the source followed in chapter 16: but
this chapter was taken in all probability from Valerius Antias, so that
the rival account is more probably from Coelius than from any other
source. If these conclusions be souncl we have, then, a long extract,
from chapter 18 to chapter 36, which is uniform, with the exception of
one extract from Polybius which shows traces of later insertion: and,
since this section shows traces in more than one place of dependence
upon Coelius, we may assume that it is derived throughout from him.

There seems little doubt, however, that c. 37 is not drawn from the
same source : it interrupts the order of the narrative, and in its
artistic balance 'both of thought and expression it betrays the rheto-
rical training both of mind and style so characteristic of thc specches ε
it is Livy’s comment on the narrative his authorities supply.

With chapter 38 we again return to the narrative and the annalists.
The story of the capture of Salapia is given in Appian1, but with great
difference of detail with regard to the actual capture of thc place—
differences great enough to make one hesitate before claiming the same
source for the two narrativcs. Appian’s source is, perhaps, Coelius, and
Livy may be abridging his narrative here, or Appian may have
expanded it from some other source. The evidence does not seem to
warrant a definite conclusion.

With the phrase per idem tempus of c. 39 we come upon a new sec-tion
and a new authority as in c. 24. 1. The accurate information possessed
on the one hand with regard to the small (letachment of the Roman
navy at¹ Regium ( c. 39. 3—5) and of the Roman movements at Tarentum
(c. 39. 20—22), the patriotic tone of the whole (see esp. c. 40. 11), com-
bined with the use of the unusual Greek name Sybaris instead of
Thurii (c. 39. 7), point to a Roman source that had made use of a Greek
original. Claudius, who relied upon the Graeci Aciliani libm’2, answers
admirably to the description.

A systematic study of a single book of Livy gives a better idea of
the methods of the historian in using his materials than pages of
generalities. ch can see the wantos any consistent critical critcrion,
