xviii INTRODUCTION

question is reopened‚ ost-cnsibly at the request of the Campanians,
during the next year, without the slightest reference to any previous
settlement by the Senate, and settled in pretty much the same
way. In the present passage we are left in some doubt as to
the authority to whom the settlement was due until the very end
of the account ¹. It is hard to resist the conclusion ² that Livy found
the details of the settlement put under different years by two differ-
ent authorities. It does not seem possible in this section to determine
the identity of his authorities by any internal evidence: we can at
most assume that the main authority followed is probably the same
as in the two sections preceding.

With c. 17 Livy turns to the war in Spain, which occupies cc. 17—
20. 6. In c. 17 we have a specimen of Livy at his worst. The
geography can only be brought within the bounds of possibility by
an alteration in the text, which puts the Roman strategy outside the
bounds of probability and certainly outside the possibility of
comprehension ³. The indifference to accuracy in geography and
the description of military operations is characteristic not alone of
Livy, but of the whole school of ‘rhetorical’ historians ⁴. We are
on firmer ground when we come to the narrative of Scipio's appoint-
ment to the command of the war in Spain in c. 19. It will be more
convenient to discuss the sections relating to the Spanish war
together, though Livy has been compelled by the annalistic plan
of his work to group the operations by years. The sections are cc. 17-
20. 6 and cc. 41—51.

The prorenance of c. 17 is hard to trace and hardly worth the q

tracing: it evidently comes from some annalistic source. The account
of Scipio and his appointment (cc. 18, 19) is from the same stand-
point as Polybius’ account ⁵, but is clearly not borrowed directly from
him : whatever the source was, it was also used by Appian ⁶. Now
Polybius expressly names Laelius as his authority for much of his
information about Scipio ⁷, and Livy and Appian follow an account
which, while depending in the main upon the Laelian tradition,

¹ c. 17. 1 ; the fact could hardly be inferred from c. 16. 4.
