164 LIV Y. BOOK XXVI

ξ 3. scripserim. . . sequar, ‘if my authority were Silenus Ι should have
given the number as': the perf. denotcs a single action already com-
ploted, the present an action still continuing3 cf. Roby, ξς 1530, 1532,
who quotes quos, m' mearum restsme, Ι actm flammae tulerint (Vir0 fr. Aen. ii. 600)-
so also xxvii. 27. 12 mullos cerea unam 'tem ambitus fecerim, εἰ . . ,οηιηία exequi
uelim. Blase in Plcz'loloytts lxiii. 636 sq.s:'1)S (overlooking the parallel in
xxvii. 27. 12) that this is the only instance outside old Latin in which
a Perf. Subj. is used with the meaning of a present in the apodosis
of a conditional sentence: he explains the use of the perfect as due
to a desire to obviate confusion with a future conditional, scribam si sequar.

Silenum ε a Greek writer, a friend of Hannibal’s, who had accompanied
him during his campaigns and written an account of thern. He is probably
quoted by Livy from some Roman source in which his work had been used
(Corn. Nep. Hann. 13 ; Cic. Diu. i. 49).

valerium : Valerius Antias a Roman annalist, more often quoted by
Livy than any other authority. Livy follows him blindly in his earlier
books, but finding out his exaggerations later on he has no words too
hard to describe him7 eg. xxxiii. 10. 8 si V. quis credat onmium rerum
immodice munerum (laycali. His history reached as far as the time of Sulla
(Teuffel. Rom. Lz't. E. T. p. 227 sqf.

decem et tria: much less usual than tredecim: so decem el octo for
duodeuiqinti in xxvii. 29. 8.

adeo, ‘so wild are his exaggerations ' : for modus see c. 41. 11 n.

ne . . . quidem, ‘nor is there any agreement, either⁷ as to the
names of the commanders’ For this use of ne . . . quidem—a stronger
neque—cf. Madv. ξ 457.

ξ 4. plerique : including Polybius.

ξ 5. Arinen ; Silius Italicus (xv. 232, 244} calls him Aris.

Antias Valerius : note the transposition of the nomen and coanomen :
so Crassus Licinius for Licinius Crassus in xxvii. 6. 17.

ξ 6. redactae, ‘ paid in,⁷ sc. ad quaestor-enm cf. ingentique praeda est potitus;
cuius pars maxima ad quaestorem redacta est, v. 19. 8.

aliqujs=aliquibns (dat.); cf. c. 15. 3: ccliqznc's is here stronger than
quibus, ⁶ if I must agree at least with some of them.’

media, ⁴ truth is most likely to be found between the extremes!

§ ⁸7. ceterum, ‘'be that as it may ' (δ’ οὖν), rcsuming after a parenthesis 3
so in c. 12. 1 after a similar digression in c. 11. 10—13.

uniuersos : stronger than omnes, ‘ one and a11‚’ ἅπαντας.

bonum . . . habere : παρεκάλεσε θαρρεῖν, generally bono animo esse, ⁸ be
of good cheer ’—a rather colloquial phrase frequent in Comedy.

iussit ε sc. Scipio ; cf. the similar omission in c. 46. 3.

§8— fide: fide ac societate answers to frisii seruitio, ‘loyal friendship,'
‘sullen subjection.'
