Nonius Marcellus (i. p. 65, ed. Miillcr) :

and Pliny (N. H. x. 43. (60), ξ 122) says there was a Rediczdi campus
on the right of the ria Appia at the second milestonc. This was
probably some very ancient shrine ot' a lm· 01· tend« of Rome, and its
connexion with Hannibal was later. The ascription of the preserva-
tion of Rome to its influence need not imply the further statement of
Festus, thatrit was so called because Hannibal turned back at that
point. His Nuniidian cavalry may have come nearest to the town at
this point, and have been frightened away by portents. whatever
the truth on this point may be, it is evident that Tutanus was early
eredited with having driven back Hannibal. If his shrine stood near
the Capene Gate, it would readily give rise to the legend that it was
at that gate that Hannibal‘s assault was 1na‹le; and from this there
was only one step to the infer-once that he had come by one os the
roads that entered Rome at this point.

an CARTIIAGE.

ΤΗΕ descriptions of the site of New Carthago given by Livy
(xxvi. 42. 6 sqq.) and Polybius (x. 10). whatever difficulty there may
be in reconciling them with known facts, are, at any rate, precise in
themselves and consistent with each other. Each mentions some—
thing omitted by the other, but the two accounts rest evidently in
the last resort upon a common authority. A coinbination of the (lata.
furnished by them both gives us the following account of the site.

New Carthago is built upon a hilly peninsula, which pmJects into
a bay extending inland about two miles and a half froin the mouth ς
the entrance of this bay faces south-wsst, and is protected from al]
winds with the exception of that blowing from the mouth past
a small island⁷ which eloses the entrance except for a narrow passage
