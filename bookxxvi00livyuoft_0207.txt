HANNIBAL’S Ix'oc'rr: mom Cart-A 10 Rom: (cc, 7-11).

THE ancient authorities for Hannibal‘s famous march upon Rome
froin Capua are hopelessly at vari-auce, both as to the route he
followed and the object of his march. Livy's account- is strangely
confused, ancl is almost certainly a combination of two distinct
version& Polybius’ narrative is explicit enough so far as it goes,
but it leaves us altogether in the dark as to the precise route he
supposed Hannibal to have take11; Appian is extremely vague;
Coelius, like Livy, professes to give a complete itinerury.

To take the question of the line of march first: according to Livy,
Hannibal crossed the Vulturnus, and marched past Cales along the
Latin Way till he reached Labici. Thence, turning to the left, he
crossed Mount Algidus to Tusculum, and marched from it to Gabii and
so into the asser Pupim'ensis, where he pitched his first camp. His
second camp was pitched at- the Anio (Kc. 10. 3); but we find that
when he cros-ses the Anio to offer battle to the Romans, he is between
the city and the river (c. 11. 1). Either he must have crossed the
Anio before pitching his camp at it—of which Livy does not give
a hint—-or Livy is following in these 1›assages an account which
placed Hannibal's camp on the fai· side os the river from Rome, and
therefore cannot have supposed him to corne by the Latin Way, but
by some route approaching Rome froin the north or north-east. of
such an account Livy is well aware; it is that of Coelius Antipater,
our knowledge of which we owe to Livy's candour. Coelius (c. 11. 10)
made Hannibal come by a curiously devious route; from Campania
into Samnium and the Paeligni, past Sulmo into the Marrucini, then
via the territory of Alba to the Marsi, thence to Amiternum and
Foruli, Cutiliae and Reate, and so down the ria Salaria. After giving
this route in full, Livy tells us that he fully admits that Hannibal
once followed this route; but it was on his return to Capua, not on
his march from it.

Polybius' account is contained in ix, 4 sqq, but unfortunately it
