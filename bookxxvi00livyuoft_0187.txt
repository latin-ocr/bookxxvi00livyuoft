Africo ε the S.W. wind, the Λίψ of Polybius
retractus, ‘ receding about . . . from the entrance!
ξ 8. ostio, ‘at the mouth‚’ ε’πῖ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ (Polybius). This is

a misstatement. The island (Eseombreraj is only a quarter of a mile long
and lies so far from the mouth that it could not possibly afford any
protection to the bay. [Cuntz, Polybius und sein Werlc, p. 13).

obiecta, ‘closing it on the side of the sea.’

Africo ε se. ab: the island lies not SW. but SSE. of the mouth of tho
bay (Cuntz, ut supra).

ab occasu, ‘ on the west it is bounded by a lake which extends round
for some distance to the north, varying in depth as the tide risos and
falls-J Livy does not- state clearly. as Polybius does, that tlic lake was

ς 9. iugum, ‘a tongue of Iand.’

patens, ‘ wide.'

unde=ab urbe, ‘on the side fac-ing the eity.'

CHAPTER XLIII

ξ 1. cetera, ‘after finishing all the stmtssications he had to construet,
he inustered the ships in the harbour': Weissenborn-Mulier say the
meaning is obscure: but cetera does not mean ‘the other fortifications'
in contrast to those already detailed in e. 42. 6 and 10, but contrasts the
fortilieations with the ships (naues etiam) : celei-(i νμιαο munienda erant being
thus merely the ‹Inplea- uallum which he construe-ted first. For this use of
‘celera cf. the common Greek construction with ἄλλος.

ostentans, ‘threatening a bloekade by sea as well': he ineant to
employ oppzthatio (see e. 44. 1) not obsidio against the city, but tho
garrison would not know this.

praefectos, ‘the commanders'; the adiniral was called praefeclus
classis, e. 48. 7.

uigilias nocturnas: note the redundaney: uigilia in itself refers to
the night ; so ix. 24. 5 ἀίω-»κιρ stationes ac nocem-nae uigiliae.

intenti, ‘ on the alert.'

omnia, *that an enemy at the opening of a siege leaves no place
untried at any points dependIng on verb of saying iinplicd in monuisset.
