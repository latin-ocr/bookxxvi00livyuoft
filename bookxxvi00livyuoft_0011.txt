INTRODUOTION

T1TUS Livius was born in 59, or according to another version 57,
B.c.‚ at Patavium, the modern Padua. The town was one of the oldest in
Italy, and dated in the fond imaginations of its patriots from the days of
Antenor, thc companion of Aeneas in his flight from Tr0y¹. XVhatever
'its origin, Patavium had an honourable history. During the storms
of the Gallie invasions, this little corner of Italy alone kept the Gauls
at bay ², it beat off the Lacedaemoniam marauder, Cleonymus ³, and,
when the Gauls were at last reduced to order by the Roman legions,
returned to the pursuits of peace. During the long interval between
those perilous times and the age of Livy we have only a glancc at the
history of the town—Rome was once invoked to save it from the
effects of domestic sedition, and the presence 01 1110 consul was enough
to quell the disturbance ⁴. When the Ciw‘l Wars broke out in Livy's
boyhood, Patavium took and kept the side. of Cato and the vanquished.
It shut out or expelled the messengcrs of Antonius ; it aidcd the
republican party with money. arins. and 5011110135 ; the very slaves
could not be tempted 01· dragooned into yielding up their masters
to Asinius Pollio ⁶. Its inhabitants preserved into imperial times the
ancient decorum and severity of morals that marked the best days of
the old order. Their primitive puritanism provoked the sneers of
Martial ⁷ and the praise of 1110 younger Pliny ; and 011 many a page
of Livy we can read the lament of the pin-itan provincial contrasting
the ancient sobriety and restraint of the older days, as he knew them
at Patavium in his boyhood, with the newer licence and excess of the
Capital 111 the days of his prime s'.

Of Livy's family and training ive know nothing but what is based
upon conjecture. Hc praises his own town, but says nothing of his
own family. That 110 received the last finish of a rhetorical training
