§4. successit. There is almost certainly some inistake here. Nero
was sent out in 211 in the autumn aster the capture of Capua (c. 17. 1).
He meets with indifferent success and finally the senate dec-ides to ask
the people to appoint a proconsul (c. 18. 4). Scipio is appointed and goes
out during the sanie year with Silanus= aa his assistant with the rank os
propraetor; and then we are suddenly told that ‘thereupon Silanus
succeeded to Nero.5 If Livy’s account is correct, it was Scipio who
succeeded to Nero.⁴ But there is a good deal to 111ι ¹<aid for the view that
Silanus came in between Nero and Scipio in the year 210⁷ Scipio not going
out till 209. which is Polybius’ (late for his arrival. See the Introduction.
