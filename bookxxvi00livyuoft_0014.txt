classed with Livy, whose narrative is characterized by marvellous
smoothness and absolute transparency of style, while in his
speeehes his eloquence is beyond expression: so excellently is every
word adapted alike to the circumstances and the character of the
speaker; while no histor-ian has ever (to put it soberly) represented
feeling more perfectly‚ especially feelings of the gentler type.'
Elsewhere Quintilian in one of his happy, untranslateable phrases
has summed up Livy's style in two words: laete« ubertas ¹.

Livy was a stylist by nature and a historiari by force of circum-
stances. His period of litei-ary production comes at the beginning
of the great silence that fell with the rise of the Empire upon the
law courts and the forum. Oratory2 was shut up in the schools
where professors took generation after generation of pupils over trite
and innocuous themes, or committed its burning periods to writing
upon some academie and barren subject. The eloquence that in the
forum had found its perfeetion in the shapely period that, winding
in and out from clause to clause, assumed with every word a clearer
meaning, the simplicity and perfeetion of civic orat0ry‚ were now no
more. Their place is taken by a more involved and tortuous period,
the leisurely production of nien of ease for an audience with nothing
to do but to listen. The simplicity of a less sophisticated age gave
way to a smart-ness that aimed at violent contrasts and elever
antitheses, delighting the ear and fatiguing the mind by their
very brilliancy, or wit took refuge in obscure images and metaphors
that had to be tracked and snared in the inmost recesses of the
sentence. Quintilian quotes from Livy the story of a professor who
found fault with his pupils for putting their meaning clearly, and
kept saying σκότισον, σκότισον. His delight knew no bounds if a
pupil succeeded in evolving a sentence in which even his practised
penetration could discover no glimmer of sense in the thick darkness
of words-³. At the very beginning of all this came Livy. His
history was written under the conditions that made it all possible.
He was himself a close student of Demosthenes and Cicero ⁴ and his
