INTRODUCTION xvii

Antipater followed Silenus ¹, who was specially retained by Hannibal.
as Callisthenes was by Alexander the Great, to write the history of his
campaigns, and who would of course tell his story from the Cartha-
ginian standpoint. We shall not be far wrong in seeing in the alii
Coelius Antipater. The other account comes probably from Valerius
Antias, whose exaggeration was notorious. The inference is strength-
ened by comparing the next instance of discrepantia auctorum, that in
c. 11. 10. Here Livy himself expressly gives Coelius as his authority
for the alternative account to the one followed in the main narrative,
and here again we find traces of Valerius Antias as the source for the
main body of the story. We have the same patriotic standpoint, and,
more important still, it is the advice of a Valerius that saves Rome 2.
When we consider the part. played by the Fabii iu the annals of
Fabius Pictor we feel some confidence in finding here again the
traces of Valerius Antias. Yet Livy does not here follow his author
consistently, but conibines the two accounts of the last stages of Han-
nibal’s march in a way that makes shipwreck of probability and geo-
graphy ⁴.

Livy pauses again at the beginning of c. 16 to sum up fora third
time the discrepancies between the authority he has followed and
the quidam he has not followed, in reg-ard to the actual capture and
settlement of Capua. Virrius' speech of course is, in expression at
least, Livy's own production‚ so are probably the details of the
contents of the letter⁷³ sent to Hannibal. In Livy’s account Flaccus
is the most prominent person, Appius* inactivity being variously
explained: but Polybius does not seem to know of Flaccus being at
Capua at all : Appius is to him the general of the army ⁸³. The minor
discrepancies Livy has catalogued himself, but there is one serious
confusion of which he seems unconscious. The fate of the Campanians
Ι is discussed twice and settled twice by the Senate: the first account
is in c. 16. 6-13, and is apparently final: but in c. 33 the whole
