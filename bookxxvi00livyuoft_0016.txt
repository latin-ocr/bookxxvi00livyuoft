xii INTRODUCTION

15 wearied with the pompous procession he is again transported to
a narrative written in a style conspicuously plain and unadorned.

The one fault which ancient critics could find with his style—apart
from Pollio's Patam'nitas—was its redundancy. Quintilian¹ quotes
a rather extreme case: leyati non ιὐψείναΐα pace retro domum, uncle
uenerant, abierunt. He does not often go so far as this, but he
sometimes goes farther than perfect simplicity of style would allow².

It is in the speeches‚ however, scattcred through his work, 111 1110
fashion set hy Thucydide& and with less than Thucydides’ pretensions
to historical accur-acy, that Livy's art 15 seen at its best. Here he is
in his clement, and. his rhetorical talent has full sway. If one
compares them with the spceches in Polybius 01· 1110 00110011011
105011011 from the wreck of Sallust's history, one sees at a glauce the
immeasurable superiority of Livy. Not only are they splendid
rhetoric, but an attempt is always made to give, 111 technical
rhetorical phraseology, ἦθος 10 1110 composition. How well, for
instance, is Scipio's character sketched in a few slight strokes 111
1110 speech he delivers to his soldiers before they start for New
Carthage ³, and again with consummate skill in the short speech to
Aluccius after the capture of the town⁴; we see Scipio’s whole
character bared before 115 'uotiua ueluti descripta tabella. The self·

kindliness and bonhomie of the youthful patrician‚ too kindly to be
a prig, and 100 young 1ο know how near he comes 10 being one,
combine to form a charming and natural figure in Livy's gallery of
Roman imperators.

For many of the details of Livy‘s syntax and vocabulary the reader
must be referred to the notes: but a short summ-ary will not be out
of place here.

Livy's vocabulary is largely coloured by words drawn from the
poem, particularly Vergil and the earlier poets whom Vergil imitateffi,
as well as from the more familiar vocabulary of comedy and every-
day life 6. Ηο 15 fond of using the plural for the singular after the
