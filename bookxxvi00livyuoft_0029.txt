INTRODUCTION xxv

the carelessness in points of detail, the anxiety to give a narrative
more complete than one’s predecessors leading to the combination
of contradictory accounts or the insertion of paragraphs at distinct
variance with their context. Such an analysis is like sinking a pit
on a prehistoric site and inferring something from its super-imposed
strata as to the vicissitudes and development that marked its history.

There is much in Livy‘s methods to shock modern ideas of what
history ought to be, and perhaps not a little for which there is some
thing to be said. Probably what will strike a modern reader as the
most directly unscientific feature (if indeed so mild a word would be
employed) is the habit of inserting speeches for even the main tenor
of which he could not possibly have the most remote authority. And
yet it may be urged that a practice and a conception of history
that have given us the speeches of Thucydides may have, at least,
something to be said in their favour. No deception was intended by
the fiction, no wrong impression was conveyed ¹. It was a perfectly
well understood convention that there were certain occasions to
which full justice could only be done. phases of character to which
adequate and dramatic expression could only be given, by the employ-
ment of the spoken word. A political crisis is never so well understood,
divergent interests are never so sharply presented and so unerringly
gmsped, as when the leaders give expression to the inner principles of
their palty or their progr-anime with all the bluntness and partiality
of untrammelled uttcrance. What the envy of time had denied to
succeeding generations the historian undertook to supply. Where
a speech actually delivered had been lost he invented from his know-
ledge of the period the form which the speech had probably taken, or
ought to have taken had the orator risen to his opportunity: where
no speech had becn delivered, the historian supplied for his readers
what circumstances had failed to bestow upon a vainly expectant
generation. And by the rules of his art he was compelled to adapt
his speech to the character of the supposed speaker. A speech that
would be delivered by an Athenian could under no conceivable circum-
stances be attributed to a Spartan: what Camillus might have said
would never be let fall from the lips of Cato. In the hands of a
master the effect was to present a situation in a strikingly virid and
