CHAPTER XLVII

ξ 1. capitum, ‘'personsf so in 0. 49. 2. The head being looked on as
the seat of life, it was used as a synonym for the person just as we say
‘ souls' in English [ef. Gk. κεφαλή). Ι11 Rome it was also used to denote
the sum total of the rights belonging to an individual citizen, as in the
phrase capt‘tis deminutio.

uirile secus: adverbial accusative, R‹‚hy‚ ξ ¹104: secus is an old
neuter used only in this phrase and in ›nnliebse secus.

inde = cuc eis.

dimisit : ἀπέλυσε εἠῖ τὰς ι’δὶας οἰκήσεις (I'olyb.). · lot gt· free!

sua, ‘their property ’: sor sam referring to a noun other than 'the
subjeet see Madv. ξ 490 *b ⁷ who quotes desinam! insidiari ‘lomi snae consuls,
‘in his own house‚’ Cic. Cat. i. 13. 32.

relica: cf. qaus relicus siu-tuna . . . ,ἤτω-«ιν, ix. 24. 13 ε smne-times the
partitive gell. rclirt' is used. especially afim· nihil, mg. sum . . . w'lte‘l nohis
fortuna relleiseceril, vii. 35. 8.

§a opifices, · el·afts111en,’ slaves 01· freedmen. They do not seem to
be included in the libem rapida mentioned above. It is· true that Polybius
(x. 17. 6) reekons the total number of'captives at ‘little less than ten
thousand‚' and this might seem at first sight to make it necessary t«)
include Livy's two thousand opifices among the ten thousand libera capita.
But Polybius includes in his numbering women and children, whereas
-Livy makes the free males alono number about ten thousand ; so that in
any case Livy's numbers are in exeess of those of Polybius, and it seems
useless to attempt to argue from the numbers in one account to those
in the other. Polybius says nothing about slaves.

publicos: δημόσιοι τῆς Ῥώμης (Polyb. loe. cit.) ; cf. publica populi
, Romanisacta, e. 16. 8.
§3- ceteram, ‘the rest of then1‚' i. e. those not included among the
’ ciues Carthaginis (who were only part of the libera capita] and the opifices ε
’ the following genitives are explanatory, · namely the younger inhabitants
3' and the able-bodied slaves!
incolarum: cf. 0. 16. 8, where the incolae and libertini are contrasted
’ with the opifices and ins‘ilores. These incolae iuuenes were probably the
¹ grown-up sons of the cinus and any other freemen living at New Carthage
who were not citizens, Polybius merely says ὲκ δὲ τῶν λοιπῶν αἰχμαλώτων
ἐκλέξας τοὺς εὐρωστοτάτους καὶ τοῖς εἴδεσι καῖ ταῖς ἡλικίαις ἀκμαιοτάτους προσέ-
μιξε τοῖς αὐτοῦ πληρώμασι (x. 17. 11).

in. classem : in denotes the object aimed at ς ef. sueh phrases as ‘lare
se insu-qam, dare hostem in conspectum (iii. 69. 9).

ad supplementum τ cf. in supplementum, e. 11. 5.

captiuis = captis: ef. uastam = uastatam, c. 35. 5.
