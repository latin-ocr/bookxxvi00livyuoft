116 LIVY. BOOK XXV]

argentariae: see c. 11. 7 n. These offices were rebuilt in 192 13.c.,
and renamed nouae to distinguish them from the qzu'nque tabernae already
built.

§ 3. basilicae : in Livy’s· time the space round the Forum was taken up
with public buildings and basilicae ι he adds neque euim tum basilicae erant
to explain how it was that priuata aedificia could catch fire from burning
shops in the Forum. The basilicae were large halls surrounded by a
colonnade in which the public could walk during rain or take shelter from
heat in summer. The interior was sometimes used as a court ofjustiee.
In Livy’s day there were the Basilica Iulia south-west of the Forum, the
Basilica Aemilia to the north-east, and the Basilica Opimia to the north.

lautumiae: the region to the north-west of the Forum, containing
the State prison 01· lautumiae, so called from the λατομίαι, the ‘stone
quarries' which at Syracuse were used as a prison. [A place believed to have
been a prison has very receutly been excavated on the north—east side of
the Forum, near the temple of Faustina and close to the fornix Fabianus.
The level of the floor is that of the Forum about the third century Rc.
It seems very probable that this was the lautumiae referred to in the text.
See E. Burton-Brown, Rei-ent Excaz‘atimoe iu ilie Roman Forum, p. 169. T.W.D.]

forum piscatorium, ‘the fish markom* lying to the north os the
Forum, under the Carinae.

atrium regium: identified by Homo (op. cii. s. v.) with the Atrium
Vestae, to the south os the Forum, bordering on the Noua Via. It was
supposed to be the ancient ‘royal hall' of the regal period. [1 think
the identification of the atrium regnum by Weissenborn-Malla· with the
atrium Vestae more than doubtful. The fire was spreading eastwards from
the site subsequently occupied by the Bas-illcae on the north side of the
Forum via the lautumiae and the fish market to the atrium regium, and
when this took fire it threatened the temple of Vesta. Nearer to the
course of the flames than the atrium Vestae (residence of the Vestals) was
the domus publica, the official residence of the pontufer maximus, a building
distinct from the reyia, the scene of his official duties. The domus publica
was as near the temple of Vesta as was the atrium Vestae and atrium
‘regium seems a very natural name for it. The flames passed along the
north side of the Sacra Vz'a until they reached the For-uix Fabianus, where
there seems to have been a guard-house on the other side of the street,
with some private houses adjacent to convey the fire on to the domus
publica, which was hard by. These flames could not have reached the
atrium Vestae except by way of the (lomus publica, and isit had been burnt
we should expect the fact ts) be mentioned. See the map in Bul-ton-
Brown, op. cit. facing p. 214. T.W.D.]
