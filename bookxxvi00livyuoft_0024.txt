xx INTRODUCTJOA'

Coelius and Valerius. We have here then an authority which was
neither Coelius nor Valerius, but a Roman writer with a knowledge
of Polybius, as is shown by the very close agreement with him on
many points which can hardly be independent. All this seems to
point to Claudius Quadrigarius¹—a conclusion supported by the
peculiarity of the chronology.

The chronology of these Spanish extracts is an exceedingly
difficult question, which has been solved by the acuteness of
Soltau ². Livy gives the following order of events: In March 211
(c. 2. 1) a despatch reaches the Senate from Marcius in Spain asking
for provisions and clothing for the troops: after the capt-ure of
Capua in the same year, Nero is sent to Spain (c. 17. Ι) : immediately
after, the Senate and people agree to send out Scipio, who reaches
Spain at the end of the same season (c. 20. 7) along with M. Junius
Silanus, who replaces Nero (c. 20. 4). Scipio spends t-he winter at
Tarraco and early in the following year (210) captures New Carthage.
All this is confusing enough: but it becomes still more confusing
when we find that Polybius knows nothing of Nero and puts the
capture in 209.

Now when Livy takes his dates directly from Polybius he often
falls into an error in expressing Polybius’ Olympiads in terms of the
Roman official year, which began six months later, and in doing so he
puts the events a year too late. Here, for instance, he would, had
he copied Polybius directly, have put the capture of New Carthage
in 208.

It seems to follow, not merely that the authority whom Livy is
following was not Polybius, but that he was an author who adopted
an entirely different system of chronology. Now Livy in some places ⁸
dates events by the number of years since the outbreak of the war:
but authorities differed on the date of the outbreak; some, like Cato,
reckoning it from 219, others, as Livy generally does, from 218.
Among the former was Claudius Quadriga1·ius⁴‚ and if Livy is
following his reckoning here the divergence in the date of the
capture of New Carthage is explained: Claudius, finding it in his,
authority assigned to the tenth year of the. war, put it under the tenth
