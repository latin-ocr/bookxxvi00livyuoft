dramatic form, and in such hands the risk of positive error or actual
misapprehension was reduced to a minimum. The methodis liable to
abuse and is certain to bc abused in incompetent hands ι but it may
be questioned whether all the painful and prolix industry of modern
and ancient historians combined has proved the essential falsehood
of a single sentence in the fiunous speeches which open Thucydides’
narrative of the Peloponnesian war¹‚ or has done aught but obscure
the clear-cut outline of his presentment.

But Thucydideshad no successor. Polybius, whose homcfides and care-
fulness are undoubted, lacked his massive strength and restraint of
method. Livy2, with more art than Polybius and infinitely less material
for forming a correctjudgement, set himself an almost impossible task.
Not even his admirers will pretend that the political speeches of his
early books throw light upon the disputes they are, by a not too exact-
ing fiction, supposed to have been intended to solve. But what- Livy
could do he has donc. He has left us a gallery of Roman porti-aits of
splendid variety and range : a Camillus ³². a Papirius Cursor, a Scipio,
a Marcellus, a Cato, stand. clearly marked types of character, upon his
pages. No one who has seen the ferocity of outraged majesty in
Papirius ⁴, the kindly and romantio egotism of Scipio ⁵, the indignant
shame of Marcellus before his craven troops ⁰, the pungent Cato
cynically defending the Oppian Law Τ, can ever forget the features of
these masterly porti-aits. No one can either affirm or deny their ι
historical fidelity: but that the Roman world accepted them as the
almost official expression of their conception of the mores Romani con-
fers upon them an ideal validity which we cannot afford to despise.

Livy projects into the past the contemporary ideals of Roman
character: he projects into the past also his ideals of Roman conduct.
