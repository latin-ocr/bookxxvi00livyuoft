verifying their facts: and rhetoric pure and simple found a field

for its untrammelled exercise in the speeches with which on the ·

authority of Herodotus and Thucydides they interlarded their
histories. Polybius complains bitterly of the inaccuracy of his
predecessors who thought less and less of facts and more and more
of style ¹.

Such a reproach could not be urged at first against the Roman
annalists, who, however guilty they were of lapses in their historical
accur-acy, were certainly entirely guiltless of possessing a style.
Cicero dwells on their dryness, their intolerable dullness, again and
again 2. Coelius Antipater was the first who had any pretensions
to writing an artistic history ³. Under Greek influence‚ and thanks,
no doubt, in great measure to Cicero's persistent advocacy of the
claims of ‘art' in history, the Roman histor-ian>⁴ at last chose the
broad path. They polished their style more and more, they imitated
the mannerisms of this and that Greek historiari. Sallust, for
instance, took Thucydides for his model. Had he imitated Thucydides
in everything, the result had been different3 but he almost seemed
to think that an array of sententiae, abrupt transitions, and polished
speeches inserted at the proper intervals were the root of the matter :
of ‘pragmatio ⁹ history, as Polybius called it, he seems to have had
little idea. What this ‘rhetorical’ history came to in the end has
been told with learning and brilliancy by Hermann Peter ⁴. It came
to be the fashion for the histor-ian to hold himself far above merc
vulgar details, to avoid committing himself to definite nummus to
be as loose as possible in reference to dateS, even to withhold thc
names of persons and places essentia] to the proper understanding
of thc narrative, or to refer to them by some vague rhetorical
periphrasis. Each writer, as he copied, at the same time embellished,
his original: and we can trace through successive historians the
succeeding stages of exaggeration till what was a comparatively
