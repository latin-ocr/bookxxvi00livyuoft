INTRODUCTION xxi

from 219, i. c. in 210, and Livy adopts the date without taking into
account that the terminas a quo differs from his own.

If the capture then took place in 209, and Polybius is almost
certain to be right, Scipio reached Spain first in 210, and if Nero
were sent in 211 he was sent out a full year before Scipio's arrival.
The only question that remains is: by whom was Nero supersedecl‘?
Livy says expressly, by Silanus: but if Silanus was merely adiutor to
Scipio, while Nero was (though only of praetorian rank) commander
for the time being, he would be succeeded by Scipio. Perhaps what
happened was that Nero went out in the summer of 211, and was
succeeded in March 210, the opening of the next official year, by
Silanus. In the summer of 210 the Senate and people decided on
more vigorous ineasures in Spain and nominated Scipio to the
command, Silanus being retained as adiutor to the new commander-
in-chief. In the uncertainty of the whole question this is perhaps
as probable a solution as any other ¹.

To come back to the order of the narrative. Chapter 21 comestioni
some annalistic source, and c. 23 is drawn originally from the cmnales
maximi, c. 22 being probably a combination of both sources. The
question of the authority to whom Livy owes these chapters will bc
discussed later. With cc. 24—26. 4 we come to the narrative of con-
temporary affairs in Greece, loosely joined to the preceding in Livy's
usual style by pe}- idem tempas 2. That this section is drawn from a
Greek source is probable from the use of Greek forms of the proper
names Macedonas (c. 24. 5), Acarnanas (c. 24. 6), Leucata (c. 26. 1) : this
is further supported by the intimate knowledge shown of Greek
geogr-aphy, politics, and diplom-acy: Polybius is pointed to by the
brief geographical parentheses (c. 24. 15; 26. 2) so characteristic of
his style, and the matter, so far as we can judge from the fragments
of this part of Polybius which have been preserved, is identical in
both historialis. We cannot be far wrong in seeing here a transcript
of Polybius. On the other hand it is certain that Liry did not begin

the question of Nero s successor undecided.

as well as of subject· ‚ cf. ι’·ηίει haec c. 10. 3, where there is nothing but this
phrase to mark tho change from Valerius to Coelius : v. note ad loc. So

source of c. 17 to Coelius Antipater.
