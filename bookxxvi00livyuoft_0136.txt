ᾗ 1. ab . . . aeta, ‘after such a ltu-ccipitate decision ⁹: the phrase forms,
with quam, an adjectival supplement to sollicitudinem curamque.

ita, ‘in such a way,' explained by wayno elatoque animo.

ξ2. impleret¹ . . . solet, ‘inspired them with inore hope and con-
fidence than usually springs either from trust in a man‘s promises or
from reasoning upon reliable data? The genitive (spes is more usual
in Livy than the abl. after impleo {Robyy ᾗ 1335); quam φιαηῐαηιερηιιυι
θα est qzcczm, ‘than is that which7' the second quam being changed to
quantam for euphony after ea esc has been omitted: cf. quam quanta belli
sama fuerat, i. 35. 7 3 fiducia rernm is abstract for concrete: cf. Tac. Ayr. 10
rerum fide tradentur.

ἐ 3. Scipio. It is worth while to enunpare the description of Scipio's
character given by Polybius, who believes his apparent piety to have
been altogether a pretence to impose upon the vulgar: he says Πόπλιος
. . . ἐνεργαζόμενος ἀεὶ δόξαν τοῖς πολλοῖς ὡς μετὰ τῆς θείας ἐπιπνοίας ποιούμενος
τὰς ἐπιβολάς, εὐθαρσεστέρους καὶ προθυμοτέρους κατεσκεύαζε τοὺς ὑποταττομένους
πρὸς τὰ δεινὰ τῶν ἔργων (Χ. 2. 12). Livy with greater saith in human

display thein': for ςοιιιμωςίίιις compare σιιυκροεῐίιις acl maes-tillem, Tae. A.
xiii. 20.

ξιξ. pleraque. There i* c‹.›nside1·able doubt as to the reading here:
with the reading a& in the text it seems best to take uisa and monita as
agreeing with pleraque and vacate as a. kind of abl. of place, ‘generally‚ in
addressing the people, laying claim to insight received in visione of the
night or pretending to a supernatural inner (mente) warning.’ Omitting
nt and reading uisas, wc must take mente monna as an abl. abs.‚ and trans-
late, ‘generally addressing the people after his thoughts had been stirred
by visions of the night or by a pretended (wclnffi divine inspi1·ation.’

capti . . animi: gen. of description after ipse. which is in apposition
to Scipio, capti, ‘affecteth’ is celiteniptu(›us; cf. xxxvii. 13. 12 uiros uelutmente
capta cum *iactatione fanatica emptu-[s ἰιαίιόῐηω-ίς iv. 30. 9 quibus quaestui sunt
capti superstitione animi.

sorte, ‘the decision of an oraele' t for this sense of sors (lit.=‘lot ')
cf. i. 56. 6 responsa sortium (of the oraclo at Delphi).

§ 5. ab initio: explained by ea· (μω . . . sumpsif: the sentence beginning
