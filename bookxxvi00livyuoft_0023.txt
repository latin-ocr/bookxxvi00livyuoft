INTRODUCTION xix

combines with it other elements drawn from some other source.
This other source is also Roman and, as c. 19. 7—9 shows, was
intel-ested in prodigies, This we know to have been a characteristic
of Coelius Antipater¹. There is another indication pointing in the
same direction. In Livy’s account of Scipio in c. 19 there is a
distinct hint of a sneer in ἕξ 3, 4 arte quadam in ostentationem
compos-itm, and siue et ipse capti quadam superstitione animi are not the
expressions of a perfectly genuine admiration such as Laelius and
Polybius had. Now Coelius falls foul of the Scipio-cult elsewhere.
Livy tells us in xxi. 46. 10 that Coelius, differing from the majority
of authorities, denied to Scipio the credit of saving his father‘s life in
the battle of the Ticinus. Peter's conclusion from the latter passage
is hine quaedam ins Scipiones mccle’fflzitas elucere uidetu›·². If one is
right in seeing a similar malae'yne'tas here, the theory of the Coelian
origin of the passage becomes highly probable ⁸. With cc. 18 and 19
we must include c. 20, which can hardly be separated from them.

The case of the section contained in ce. 41-51 is in some respects
similar. Here again we have close agreement in the main with
Polybius and at the same time divergence in points of detail. That
Livy expands the speeches on his own account is but usual and
proves nothing either way 4: but his narrative offers some additional
points of interest. He knows, for instance, of the tumulus Mercurii
(c. 44. 6), of which Polybius is ignorant: he knows the names of the
quaestor Flaminius (c. 49. 10) and of the young Aluccius (c. 50. 2),
neither of which is known to Polybius: in c. 47. 7 he speaks of
poumls, not talents, the standard he would undoubtedly have em-
ployed, had he been merely transcribing Polybius, and a Roman
annalistic source is probably responsible for the narrative of the
contest for the corona muralis in c. 43, which is wanting in Polybius.
Now Livy is following a source which in c. 49. 3 he distingui hes
from Valerius Antias and Silenus, and therefore by implication from
Coelius Antipater, to whom he owed his knowledge of Silenus: it is
followed again in later books and is distinguished in xxix. 35. 2 from

¹ Peter Hist. Rom. Rell. ccxxi sq.‚ who, however, thinks this feature in
Coelius is due to his following Silenus. ’
