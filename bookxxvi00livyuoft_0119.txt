ξ 3. ad Anienem. Since in c. 11. 1 Hannibal is represented a* crossiug

Rome. Livy is following, therefore, from this point on, an authority who
represented Hannibal as advaneing on the city from tho north, and not
along the Latin Way. For inm· leave as a formula of transition from one
authority to another cf. per idem tempus, c. 24. 1 ; 40. 1.
