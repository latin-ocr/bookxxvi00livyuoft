INTRODUCTION xiii

fashion of the poets‚ and the collective singular for the plural¹. He
uses words and forms of words that in Cicero's time were counted
obsolete or soleciS111s². In many cases no doubt this was the
affectation of the rhetor-ician, but in many it was undoubtedly an
effort to break free from the more or less artificial dialect of pure
Ciceronianism‚ and it marks a genuine progress and expansion of
literary Latin. The comparative poverty of Latin in abstract expres-
sions was obviated by a widely extended use of the gerundive
and the perfect participle. Thc participle in -m-us, which in
Cicero is rarely used except in conjunction with the verb ‘to bc‚'
becomes a true future participle in Livy ²²: the perfect participle is
frequently used in the neuter both in the singular and the plural as
an abstract noun: while the use of the participle in -bunclns amounts
to a mannerism. In the use of the tenses of the subjunctive in
Oratio Obliqua‚ Livy seems often to vary arbitrarily from Primary to
Secondary Sequence z but there can bc no doubt that at least in many
cases the variation was deliberate, and an attempt to express more
fully in Oblique nai-ration thc ‹liffercuccs between the tenses of thc
Oratio Recta ⁴.

But there was still another factor ut work in determiniug Livy's
style and method. Not only had his 1·hct‹⁷›rical genius to spend its
energias in written composition instead of oral discourse‚ but the
vcry traditions of the subject he chose called for a rhetorical
treatment. Among the Greeks, the rhetorician iu history had been
the damnosa hereditas of the school of Isocrates ⁵. Ephorus and

Theopompus n thought more of polishing their periods than of
